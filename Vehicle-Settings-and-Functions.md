All vehicles that have there parent class as `RHS_C130J_Base` (_the RHS C130_) or `Helicopter_Base_F` (_basically all two door helicopters_) will get settings applied to them. The settings varies depending on the type of vehicle.

### Jump action
The jump action allow you to make a simulated static combat jump over a DZ. The action is only visible when the conditions have been met (_Default conditions; Altitude min 180 max 350, Max speed 300, and the door or ramp need to be open_).

### Get out actions
The get out actions allow players to exit thru a desired door of a helicopter (Left or Right). This allow for a better and more coordinated insertions in to AO's. The settings is always available when inside of a cargo position of a airframe and is automatically added to all supported helicopter classes.
