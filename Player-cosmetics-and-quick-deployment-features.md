## Radio channel assignations
On spawn and respawn your radio channel for short and long-range radio is set to your platoon and squads channel.

Your long range radio is also programed to have all our channels pre-setup.

## Name
Your player name is processed in cScripts to be utalized in documents and functions to reference to you with proper rank and naming. This only happens if you have our rank prefix as well as unit insignia defined. 

## Rank
Similar to the name functionality your rank prefix is processed. The rank is saved and utalized om messages and documents. In addition your rank is also set to the corresponding Arma rank.

## Team color
On Spawn you get assign team color based on your slot name, description or variable. Alpha gets assigned Red Bravo gets assigned blue. This color is reapplied on your respawn.
