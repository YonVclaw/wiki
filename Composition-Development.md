## Guidelines

## Placements of units
Placing down units is rather straight forward. To ensure the that they come in a decent order in the mission select screen can be fiddly. Remember that they appear in the selection screen as you put it down. The order is based on the group name seen in the editor.

Make sure to place down the CavAddon Named Squads.
