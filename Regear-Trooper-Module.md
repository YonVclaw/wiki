When dropped on a unit the Regear Trooper module applies a fresh [[loadout|Player Loadouts]] to the given unit based on their classname or variable name (See [[Player Loadouts]] for classname and variable documentation).

If the trooper classname or variable is not matching any of the loadouts pressent nothing will happen.

The module can be found under the **7Cav Utilities** in the Zeus module menu.

_Note! That this effect both AI and Player units._
