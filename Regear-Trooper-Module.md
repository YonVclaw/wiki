When dropped on a unit the Regear Trooper module applies a fresh [[loadout|Player Loadouts]] to the given unit based on their classname or variable name. (If the trooper classname or variable is not matching any of the loadouts there will be no effect.)

The module can be found under the 7Cav Utilities in the Zeus module menu.

_Note! That this effect both AI and Player units._
