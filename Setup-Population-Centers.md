**Avalible only on dev branch**

The system is automatically enabled when Zone Markers are placed down in eden editor with the correct naming. The naming are as followed:

* `cscripts_civilan_zone_high`
* `cscripts_civilan_zone_medium`
* `cscripts_civilan_zone_low`

_Zones can also have a suffix number example: `cscripts_civilan_zone_medium_69`._

The `high`, `medium` and `low` determine the chance of causing casualties here are the values:
```
high    0.40  (40% Chance)
medium  0.30  (30% Chance)
low     0.1   (10% Chance)
```k

> **NOTE:** Using in proper naming for density level the will default to medium numbers but it will also show density type diary records.
> Example: `cscripts_civilan_zone_banana_123` will result in: "_The location have banana density._"
