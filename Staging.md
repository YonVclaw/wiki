**Added in 4.3.31**
 
**Staging** or **Staging Zones** are a location were you can access our loadout and customization system from your ACE self interaction system.
They are automatically created around a respawn markers (`respawn_west`), staging markers (`zone_staging`),
Starter Crates and Base Crates and cover an large area around them.

_NOTE: This system is meant to eventually replace the starter crate entirely._
