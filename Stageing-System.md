**Added in 4.3.31**
 
**Staging** or **Staging Zones** are a location were you can access our loadout and custumization system from your ACE self interaction system. They are automatically created around a respawn (`respawn_west` markers or staging markers) and cover [60 meters around it](https://github.com/7Cav/cScripts/blob/master/cScripts/CavFnc/functions/init/fn_initStaging.sqf#L36) or Starter Crate and cover [25 meters surrounding the starter crate](https://github.com/7Cav/cScripts/blob/master/cScripts/CavFnc/functions/logistics/fn_doStarterCrate.sqf#L99).
