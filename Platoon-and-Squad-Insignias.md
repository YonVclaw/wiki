The insignia's can be obtainable from arsenal allowing the identity tabs or via the [[starter crate|Starter Crate]] that have its insignia selector enabled. 

As for cScripts v4.3.6 insignia's selected from the starter crate will be saved in your profile. Allow you to get the same insignia from mission to mission. If you have no insignia saved the squad or platoon default will be selected instead.
