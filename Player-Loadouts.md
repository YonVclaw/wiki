cScripts automatically distribute loadouts via a rewritten and vastly simplified version of [Poppy](https://github.com/BaerMitUmlaut/Poppy/). Each loadout is added automatically to a soldier when using  as a unit variable name or on a unit with a matching classname and set as playable. Below you find a list of supported loadouts and its corresponding classname.

## Loadout change requests
To make the prosess easy for everyone as well as speed up the process of loadout requests refrain from using names and use classnames. You can use use a ACE Arsenal export or send the individual Classname. This will avoid possible questions of what you meen or what variant of the given item you are requesting. 

If you have the ability edit the config loadout file directly this is the best way. This allows for a even quicker implementation of the requested loadout.
